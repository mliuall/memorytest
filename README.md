# memorytest

Authors: Matthew Liu & Thomas Wang

This is a recreation of the Human Benchmark Visual Memory Test

Instructions: Run main_v9 and the template will first appear with the white blocks indicating the ones to memorize. The template will show for 2 seconds, and then you will need to click on the appropriate squares. Every wrong square clicked is turned black, and if you click more than 2 wrong squares in one level, the game ends, and your score appears. Your score also appears in the Command Window every time you advance.
